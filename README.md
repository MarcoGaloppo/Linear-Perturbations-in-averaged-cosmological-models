# Linear Perturbations in averaged cosmological models
Contains the codes evolving, for four different averaged cosmological models as backgrounds, the linear covariant and gauge-invariant perturbations associated to initial fluctuations at the CMB epoch. This codes have been developed for the study presented in 	arXiv:2511.17160 (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2511.17160)
